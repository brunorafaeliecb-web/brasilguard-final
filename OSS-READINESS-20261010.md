Protocol: ORCH-MULTISKILL-BGD v0002.c — ¿00002¿B
Repository: brasilguard-final
Scope: one of six approved candidates for OSS/MIT preparation.
Status: **AUDIT_PENDING — NOT AUTHORIZED FOR MERGE OR VISIBILITY CHANGE**

## Confirmed context
Public. 5 Gitleaks findings; current web firebaseConfig apiKey looks intentionally public but historical .env and API restrictions need inspection. No blanket credential revocation.

## Mandatory evidence checklist
- [ ] Verify current source tree, full revision history, and credential findings.
- [ ] Classify public SDK keys versus private/production secrets; revoke active leaked secrets at issuer.
- [ ] Run tests, SAST, dependency inventory, security review and license compatibility checks.
- [ ] Verify provenance, copyright owners, included media/assets and third-party code.
- [ ] Review and sanitize private business, customer, infrastructure, and authentication details.
- [ ] Approve exact scope for MIT license including commercial third-party reuse.
- [ ] If repository private, confirm distinct human authorization for publication of exact reviewed snapshot.
- [ ] Re-run scans after changes; independent auditor approval; convergence and final audit.

## Governance
This file is a preparation checkpoint, not legal consent, production release, provider revocation, OSS eligibility certification, or merge approval. Preserve previous records append-only.
