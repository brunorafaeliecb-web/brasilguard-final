# BRafaelS IP audit — Evidence assessment (2026-10-10)

## Scope
One of six open-source candidates. Brand spelling **BRafaelS** (capital B, R, S) recorded by explicit owner's instruction. Brand name, logo and endorsements are not released by MIT grant; valid descriptive attribution remains permitted.

## Observed evidence
Public repo; package.json lacks license field; deps include @google/generative-ai, cors, dotenv, express; historic Gemini API key removed from active `.env` and reported revoked by owner. No root LICENSE.

## Specific unresolved risk
SECURITY/CLAIMS: reusability of vendor SDK, Firebase Web config, Gemini integrations and all service logos must be assessed; no assignment proven.

## Audit verdict
**HOLD / NOT CLEARED FOR FULL MIT PUBLIC RELEASE**.

The accessible documentation, dependency manifests and historical secret-scanner results do not independently prove authorship, copyright assignments, provenance of creative assets, or upstream license compatibility. The owner attested to key revocation; not provider-verified. No verification of Brazilian INPI trademark status is claimed.

## Required verification before approval
1. Per-file ownership and contributor provenance; written permission for externally sourced material.
2. Dependency license inventory (SPDX/SBOM) including transitive dependencies and required notices.
3. Media, trademarks, datasets, templates, client records and confidential integration segregation.
4. Owner-confirmed MIT copyright holder and scope, plus separate brand/trademark notice.
5. Independent review, release snapshot check, and affirmative authorization to merge/publish.

**No release authorization inferred from this assessment.** Preserve prior reports.
